This script is designed to work with a dictionary of passwords, where it generates all possible combinations of the passwords in the dictionary, creating `n^2` new combinations (each pair of passwords concatenated together). 

The process works in two steps:

1. **Password Combinations**: The script takes the dictionary file and creates all possible combinations by concatenating each password with every other password (including itself). These combinations are saved in the output file.

2. **Appending with '@'**: After generating the combinations, the script then processes the file and creates a modified version of each combination by appending an '@' symbol to the end of each password. The new passwords are added to the file, **preserving the original combinations and adding these modified ones with '@' at the end.**

The result is a file containing both the original combinations and their modified copies with the '@' appended, which can be useful for various purposes, such as password cracking or testing password strength.

This script automates the generation, modification, and saving of password combinations, streamlining the process of creating password lists for security testing.
